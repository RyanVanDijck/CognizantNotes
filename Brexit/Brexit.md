  * A vaild GMR cannot be presented 
  * If thier registration number does not match the GMR 
* Allows for automatic arrival in CHIEF as soon as goods board at the EU🇪🇺️ side
* Import declarations processed by HMRC en route to the UK🇬🇧️
* When vehicles have embarked, the status in GVMS will be updated to EMBARK
* When inbound goods are cleared, a notification is sent through CHIEF
* If a movement requires inspection, a notification is sent within 30 minutes after embarkation
* The vehicle must report to a customs inspection centre upon arrival, where customs official will update GVMS
